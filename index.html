                <h3>What is BOOG?</h3>
                <p>BOOG score (Better than Other Ordinary Guys) is a metric designed to separate the cream of the crop among MLB players.</p>
                <p>Calculating BOOG score is simple: it's a player's career WAA (Wins Above Average) total, with all negative seasons zeroed out and ignored.</p>
                <p>The intent is to recognize greatness on the field as measured by how far you stand above the median, rather than using replacement level as in WAR-based metrics such as JAWS.</p>
                <p>This metric leans more in favor of peak value than WAR, but still recognizes longevity <i>if a player continues to contribute at a notable level</i> above his peers.</p>
                <p>It is named for Orioles MVP first baseman and barbecue connoisseur Boog Powell, whose career trajectory is uniquely appreciated using this approach.</p>
