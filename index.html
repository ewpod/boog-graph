                <h3>What is BOOG?</h3>
                <p>BOOG score (Better than Other Ordinary Guys) is a metric designed to separate the cream of the crop among MLB players.</p>
                <p>Calculating BOOG score is simple: it's a player's career WAA (Wins Above Average) total, with all negative seasons zeroed out and ignored.</p>
                <p>The intent is to recognize greatness on the field as measured by how far you stand above the median, rather than using replacement level as in WAR-based metrics such as JAWS.</p>
                <p>This metric leans more in favor of peak value than WAR, but still recognizes longevity <em>if a player continues to contribute at a notable level</em> above his peers.</p>
                <p>It is named for Orioles MVP first baseman and barbecue connoisseur Boog Powell, whose career trajectory is uniquely appreciated using this approach.</p>
                <p><b>Median HOF</b> describes the career trajectory of a middle-of-the-road Hall of Fame inductee (split out to pitchers or position players). <b>Median BBWAA</b> is the same but for BBWAA electees only.</p>
                <p><b>Marginal HOF</b> describes the Nth best career through a given age, where N is the total current number of Hall of Fame inductees (split out to pitchers or position players). <b>Marginal BBWAA</b> is the same but for BBWAA electees only.</p>
